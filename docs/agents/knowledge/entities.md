## Entities

Source: Lua fixture, 331 samples.

- **State:** 0 = active / visible / closed, 1 = inactive / hidden / open. Triggering toggles the state.
- **Trigger_Delay:** state 1 while counting down, back to 0 when it fires.
- **Trigger_Once:** goes to state 1 after firing.
- **Env_Item:** toggles and spawns its item.
- **Env_Sound:** toggles only when looping (`ints[1]` = 0).
- **Func_GameAction:** 0 draw, 1 T win, 2 CT win, 3 restart in X s, 4 kill Ts, 5 kill CTs, 6 kill all, 7 load map.
- **Round start:** the round-end intermission is 3 s. Round start is deterministic: every state goes back
  to 0, then the Trigger_Start entities fire. Entity states are not resent at round start.
- **Dedicated quirk:** after some round restarts the dedicated stops broadcasting entity changes. The
  original client shows the same divergence.
